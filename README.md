Client Manager in C#

Hello, the Project was developed a few days ago and in accompaniment with the C# course that I'm studying and participating on Udemy: Online Courses. 
The program was developed in C#, in the model Console App(.NET Framework), it is a Client Manager, being able to add your clients, see all of them through the "List" and remove them.
The project was something relatively simple but fun to do, developing and putting into practice several concepts that I'm learning such as binary file manipulation, Struct, List, Conditional structures, Functions, Logic Applications and much more.

Thanks to my teacher Victor Lima who teaches at Udemy. :}
Let's go !
